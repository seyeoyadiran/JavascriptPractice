/* Road trip

You are planning a cross-country road trip!
The distance of the trip, in total, is 1,500 miles.
Your carâ€™s fuel efficiency is as follows:
At 55 miles per hour, you get 30 miles per gallon.
At 60 miles per hour, you get 28 miles per gallon.
At 75 miles per hour, you get 23 miles per gallon.
You have a fuel budget of $175.
The average cost of fuel is $3 per gallon.
Set up a program to answer the following questions:
How many gallons of fuel will you need for the entire trip?
Will your budget be enough to cover the fuel expense?
How long will the trip take, in hours?
Compare the results when traveling at an average of 55, 60, and 75 miles per hour. Which makes the most sense for the trip?
Log the results of your calculations using string concatenation or template literals.
